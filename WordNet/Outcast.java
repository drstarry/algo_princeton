// Measuring the semantic relatedness of two nouns. Semantic relatedness refers to the degree to which two concepts are related. Measuring semantic relatedness is a challenging problem. For example, most of us agree that George Bush and John Kennedy (two U.S. presidents) are more related than are George Bush and chimpanzee (two primates). However, not most of us agree that George Bush and Eric Arthur Blair are related concepts. But if one is aware that George Bush and Eric Arthur Blair (aka George Orwell) are both communicators, then it becomes clear that the two concepts might be related.

public class Outcast {
    // constructor takes a WordNet object
    public Outcast(WordNet wordnet) {

    }

    // given an array of WordNet nouns, return an outcast
    public String outcast(String[] nouns) {

    }

    // see test client below
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
