// Shortest ancestral path. An ancestral path between two vertices v and w in a digraph is a directed path from v to a common ancestor x, together with a directed path from w to the same ancestor x. A shortest ancestral path is an ancestral path of minimum total length.
// Corner cases.  All methods should throw a java.lang.NullPointerException if any argument is null. All methods should throw a java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException if any argument vertex is invalidâ€”not between 0 and G.V() - 1.

// Performance requirements.  All methods (and the constructor) should take time at most proportional to E + V in the worst case, where E and V are the number of edges and vertices in the digraph, respectively. Your data type should use space proportional to E + V.
